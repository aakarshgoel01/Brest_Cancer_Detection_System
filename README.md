# Brest Cancer Detection System

Welcome to the Brest Cancer Detection System repository! This project aims to develop a system for detecting breast cancer using machine learning techniques. Below you'll find information about the project, how to set it up, contribute to it, and where to find additional resources.

## What is Brest Cancer Detection System?

The Brest Cancer Detection System is a machine learning-based solution designed to assist in the early detection of breast cancer. It utilizes various algorithms to analyze medical data and provide accurate predictions regarding the presence of cancerous cells.

## Features

- Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess medical data for analysis.
- Model Training: Train machine learning models using historical data.
- Prediction: Predict the likelihood of breast cancer based on input data.
- Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of trained models using various metrics.
